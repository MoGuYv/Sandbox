# Practical 06 Reflection - Lu Junwen

## 1. What did you learn from this practical?
I learned how to design and implement custom Python classes that encapsulate both data and behavior.  
It helped me understand object-oriented programming (OOP) more clearly, especially how methods like `__init__`, `__str__`, and helper functions (`is_dynamic`, `is_vintage`) simplify logic reuse.

## 2. What was the most challenging part?
The trickiest part was remembering not to pass existing data (like year or fuel) into methods that could calculate them directly.  
It also took some time to ensure string formatting was consistent across all classes.

## 3. How did you overcome the challenges?
I reviewed the provided examples (Car and Guitar) and practiced incremental testing—writing one method at a time, printing results, and verifying expected vs. actual output before moving on.

## 4. What improvements would you make if you had more time?
I would enhance the Guitar program with file saving/loading, and add error handling for invalid input in the car simulator.  
I could also make the `Car` class more interactive (e.g., support multiple cars or tracking total fuel used).

## 5. How does this prac connect to the subject learning outcomes?
It directly connects to CP1404’s goals of developing modular and maintainable code.  
By defining reusable classes, I now understand how abstraction and encapsulation make programs easier to test, extend, and debug.
